UK immigration visa rules are clear and applying for a visa is straightforward. You need a visa if you are coming to the UK from outside of the [European Economic Area (EEA)](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) and Switzerland.

Before coming to the UK, you should:
* [check if you need a UK visa](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa)
* if necessary, book an appointment at [your nearest visa application centre](https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre)

There are more than 300 visa application centres worldwide, with application processing of less than 7 days available in more than 100 of them. In many countries, including India and China you can get a visa decision within 24 hours.
