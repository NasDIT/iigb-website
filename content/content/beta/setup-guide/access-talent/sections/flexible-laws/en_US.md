The UK’s straightforward and flexible employment laws protect and promote the interests of employees. These laws help businesses to hire and manage the right people with the right skills as and when they need them.
 
Employers have statutory responsibilities to make sure their employees have a right to work in the UK. Specific employment laws cover minimum entitlements to working conditions, pay and leave.
