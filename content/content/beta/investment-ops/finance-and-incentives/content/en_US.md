The UK has well established financial systems and a range of options available to help businesses of all types and sizes to raise finance. The UK also has the most competitive tax regime in the G20 group of countries.

## Types of funding for investing in local areas of the UK
There is an excellent private sector system of equity and debt finance available in the UK from traditional and alternative finance providers. We also have incentives if you want to invest in certain locations and industries.

### Tax relief for UK regional investment
Tax relief means that your company either pays less tax or gets a tax refund under a specific scheme.

Tax relief can support your company with more operating cash by reducing the effective tax rate further than the existing corporation tax rate, or enhance net profits after tax.

Tax relief incentives for investing in specific locations of the UK include relief on business rates and enhanced capital allowances when investing in certain environmental technologies.

### Grants for investing in specific UK locations
A grant is a non-repayable sum of money given by government or other organisation for a particular purpose.

Grants in the UK tend to be sector or location specific and vary across the UK. They usually require a minimum amount of capital investment by your company and a certain number of staff to be employed.

Grants that will support investment in particular areas of the UK include the Exceptional Regional Growth Fund.

### Financial incentives to invest in UK regions
Investors in the UK may be able to benefit from financial incentives available in areas known as enterprise zones or enterprise areas. These are designated areas of the country that provide tax breaks and government support.

Businesses that locate in an enterprise zone can access benefits that may include:

* up to 100% business rate discount, worth up to 275,000 GBP per business over a 5-year period
* simplified local authority planning
* up to 100% corporation tax relief on the cost of investments in plant and machinery

Grants and incentives change frequently, and the rules may need to be explained in detail before you make an investment decision.
