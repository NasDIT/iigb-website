The UK is home to 6 of the 10 Formula One motor racing teams. McLaren, Williams and Mercedes-Benz have all made the UK their Headquarters.

We have world-class universities. According to the QS World University Rankings, 4 of the world’s top 10 universities and 9 of the EU’s top 10 universities are in the UK.

We have leading engineering companies like Ricardo and world-class automotive research facilities thanks to the recently established [Catapult network](https://catapult.org.uk/).
